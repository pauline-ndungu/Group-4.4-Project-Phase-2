    "The aim of this project is to put into practice our newly aqcuired skills in data science to formulate and solve a real business problem. In this project, we are given a raw dataset which is the house sales prices in Northwestern County and we are supposed to formulate a real business case study and use the data to solve the business problem and provide a useful business advisory which can be used to formulate real and valuable business decisions. Unlike in phase 1, we are not given the business problem, its upon us to formulate it."

    "From the above description, we have enough data to understand the real estate market in King County. The Business problem we intend to solve is provide an advice to a real estate developer in King county on what type of houses/properties fetch the highest prices in the market, their locations, features and time of the year when homeowners are likely to purchase homes. As junior data analyst in a Real Estate Agency that markets properties on behalf of developers, we have been tasked with analyzing the house sales data in King county and advice a prospective new developer, Kings Wajenzi Developers on the type of properties that they should target for the King County Market.\n",
    "King County Population has been increasing over the last decade and therefore demand for new homes is at an all time high, especially after incomes stabilized following the end of the corona virus pandemic. \n"
